   - Implement a basic maze generation algorithm to create simple, randomized maze layouts.
   - Ensure that mazes are solvable and contain a start point and an end point.

2. Player Movement:
   - Allow the player to navigate through the maze using keyboard controls (e.g., arrow keys or WASD).
   - Implement basic movement mechanics such as moving forward, backward, and sideways.

3. Rendering with SDL2:
   - Utilize SDL2 to render the maze environment and player character on the screen.
   - Implement basic graphics rendering, including walls, corridors, and player avatar.

4. Collision Detection:
   - Implement basic collision detection to prevent the player from moving through walls.
   - Ensure that the player character interacts realistically with the maze environment.

5. Basic UI Elements:
   - Display essential UI elements such as a HUD (Heads-Up Display) showing player information like health and inventory.
   - Include basic text or graphical elements to convey game state information (e.g., current level, number of lives).

6. Gameplay Mechanics:
   - Introduce basic gameplay mechanics to engage the player and provide a sense of progression.
   - Include simple objectives or goals within the maze (e.g., reaching the end point, collecting items).
  
7. Winning Condition:
   - Define a winning condition where the player successfully navigates through the maze and reaches the end point.
   - Provide feedback or visual cues to indicate when the player has won the game.

8. Losing Condition:
   - Implement a losing condition to add challenge and consequence to the gameplay.
   - Define scenarios where the player loses (e.g., running out of health, falling into traps).

9. Audio Support:
   - Include basic audio support to enhance the gaming experience.
   - Implement sound effects for player actions (e.g., moving, collecting items) and environmental elements (e.g., opening doors, collapsing walls).

10. Basic Controls and Settings:
    - Provide basic controls for adjusting settings such as sound volume and screen resolution.
    - Include options for configuring keyboard controls to accommodate player preferences.

11. Testing and Bug Fixing:
    - Conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve any bugs or issues in the gameplay mechanics, rendering, and user interface.
    - Ensure that the game runs smoothly and without major technical issues on different platforms.

12. Documentation:
    - Provide basic documentation outlining game controls, objectives, and gameplay mechanics.
    - Include instructions for installation and setup to facilitate user engagement.
